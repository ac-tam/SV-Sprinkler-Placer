# Stardew Valley Sprinkler Placement Optimizer
A Java Swing application that can help you visualize how to layout your farm in Stardew Valley. <br>
This tool works best in the early to mid game where you have normal or quality sprinklers and you are not as concerned with the appearance of your farm.
Currently, the tool works with up to 4 scarecrows, and a future update will implement an algorithm that automatically adds scarecrows.

# Usage
The app can generate a heuristic solution that maximizes sprinkler density while preserving zero sprinkler overlap.
<br> 
All of the sprinklerâ€™s coverage is guaranteed to be in a scarecrow's range.

To start, run the <a href = "https://github.com/ac-tam/Stardew-Valley-Sprinkler-Placement-Optimizer/raw/master/Sprinkler%20Optimizer.jar">Sprinkler Optimizer.jar</a> file. Enter the number of sprinklers you have and press generate.
<br> 
A secondary window will open with the layout generated.

You can use the WASD keys to navigate accurately (Pressing it will scroll by one scarecrow's radius), or you can use the scrollbars to scroll.
